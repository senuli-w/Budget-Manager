I need you to build a very simple budget management software for my own use. 
the frontend - built with html, css, js will be hosted on github pages. 
but the data will be saved on a free database- i am thinking mongodb atlas free version - app service. 
because using app service we can use mongodb as the backend that saves the data and connect to the frontend, 
please tell me if this is possible?


if yes write the application for it. 


here are the requirements.

there are few accounts i have. (BOC, HNB, Cash)

i should be able to add the number of accounts.

in each account can add balance.

and we can put entries to increase and decrease from them.
what i mean by that is, if i use money for a payment. i can add a description, and amount, it automatically reduces the value, 
and if i make some money also its like that. should be able to do transactions from one account to another.

and need to show a dashboard also that gives me insight.
need a budget planner that can let me plan the budget expenses for the month.


just think of a general good budget tracking and income and expense recording application and build it. use a good interface. 
i want this to be customized for me. so when you create this i will use it and tell you what to change. for the mongodb connection, 
give me the steps to create a clucster and app service and how to conenct it to this app.
